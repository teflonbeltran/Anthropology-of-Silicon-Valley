# Course Schedule

##I. Historic, Economic, and Cultural Roots  
Classic texts on the historical underpinnings of the valley of gold/fruit/mercury/silicon; the military and “counter-cultural” origins of high tech development; ways in which other countries have attempted to replicate (or integrate into) the Silicon Valley. We explore ethnographies that bring us into the different worlds that coexist in the region and end with Bourdieu to discuss how we might use a theoretical framework (e.g. one based on cultural capital and fields) to ground an analysis of complex social phenomena.

We explore new directions and possibilities for research related to hacking and tech entrepreneurship. How do subjects align themselves with “risk” and flexible networks?
